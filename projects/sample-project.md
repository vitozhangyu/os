This portfolio website showcases my skills in modern web development with a unique twist - it features both a contemporary responsive design and a nostalgic Mac System 7 retro interface.

### Key Features

- **Dual Interface Design**: Modern responsive layout with dark mode toggle
- **Retro Desktop Experience**: Interactive Mac System 7 style interface
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Projects loaded from Markdown files
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Fully responsive across all devices
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and JavaScript-powered interactions

### Technical Stack

- HTML5 semantic markup
- CSS3 with custom properties and Grid/Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Markdown for content management
- Local storage for user preferences

### Design Philosophy

The project demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to create both functional and creative user experiences, bridging the gap between contemporary design principles and nostalgic computing aesthetics.
